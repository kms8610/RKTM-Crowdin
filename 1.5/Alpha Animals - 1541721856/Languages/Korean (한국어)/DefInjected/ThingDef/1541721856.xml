It has a symbiotic relationship with anima vegetation, with several Anima Trees and Mystic Cap mushrooms growing on its back. These plants seem to provide sustenance in a symbiotic relationship with the colossus.\n\nWhen tamed, the Anima Colossus can be periodically "trimmed" to obtain wood.

  <AA_AuroraSylph.description>A wispy-looking creature that is the only known example of plasma-based life in the Rim: the Aurora Sylph is of artificial origins, and its biology is so strange that only the most advanced glitterworld technology could have been responsible for its creation. It is believed that the sylphs were created as a lifeform capable of surviving in the atmosphere of Red Dwarf stars, for utterly inscrutable purposes. They don't seem to be affected by gravity much, so they can also be found stranded in the gravity well of a planet.\n\nSylphs are immune to temperature extremes, though very fragile and easy to damage. They don't need to eat, as they will replenish their energy simply by absorbing light. If they are content, they will periodically influence the magnetic fields of a planet, and cause beautiful auroras, hence their name.\n\nBased on concept art by Maugryph, https://maugryph.com.\n\nArt by AetherealVanguard (check Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/aethereaii/).</AA_AuroraSylph.description>

  <AA_BedBug.description>These oversized insects are considered a pest and a nuisance in every world they manage to infest. While not particularly dangerous or powerful on their own, their bite carries a powerful toxin that paralyzes its prey, so one small bite is enough to down prey much larger than themselves. Thankfully, humans are way too large for them, unless they are somehow maddened beyond all reason...

  <AA_DuskProwler.description>A result of failed animal weaponization trials, the dusk prowler is an ideal killing machine, built and modified to satisfy the requirements of fast-paced warfare. The fierce nature of the prowler is reinforced further by the muscular protrusions on their back, which simultaneously act as both accelerators and as weapons. Their capability to overrun even the most well defended military facilities resulted in the systematic purge that was commissioned by the intergalactic federations centuries ago, in hopes of driving the prowlers to extinction. Thus, very few prowler sightings are reported across the Rim nowadays, with those who see one almost never making it out alive to tell the tale.</AA_DuskProwler.description>

If they can't find pollen trumpets nearby, they will grudgingly resort to eating other farm plants nearby, thereby negating their usefulness to the colony. A good supply of mature pollen trumpets will be needed unless you want the butterfly to absolutely annihilate your crops.</AA_EmpressButterfly.description>

  <AA_IronhuskBeetle.description>Ironhusk beetles were genetically engineered by one of the myriad mining companies operating on the Rim. It's a peaceful farm animal that occasionally sheds metallic husks that can be used as steel, thus negating the need for heavy machinery in mining operations. As a downside, the beetle consumes a huge amount of wood from live trees.\n\nSadly, the mining company that created the Ironhusk beetles didn't account for this, and several planets on the Rim are now a barren ecological disaster.\n\nArt by Feroxiious (check her Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/feroxiious/).</AA_IronhuskBeetle.description>

Or perhaps it was stronger than average, and managed to subdue and devour its imprudent creators. In any case, it has now turned into a pulsating, fleshy behemoth with a ravenous appetite.\n\nMature fleshbeasts swallow their prey whole, storing up to 5 creatures on its huge stomach for later consumption.

Their physical weakness is compensated for with above average intellect, allowing them to outsmart organisms as intelligent as the Forsaken. Their reputation for stealthily stealing supplies across the Rim has earned them the nickname 'thief of the night'.\n\nSpecial abilities: A Murkling's bite can inflict the bubonic plague.

The most ferocious Razorjacks are specially trained, bred and further mutated into fearsome warbeasts, known as Razortooth, used by Feral warlords as terrifying warhounds.

  <AA_RedSpore.description>Similar to the Ocular Jelly, this strange creature is of unknown origin. It doesn't even seem to be carbon based, instead using gallium as the basis of its structure and life functions. This is considered physically impossible under normal circumstances, so the red spore may come from a place where the rules are wildly different from this Universe.\n\nThis fact makes the red spore inherently unstable, with a low lifespan, prone to violently explode and unable to reproduce normally. As a floating creature, Red Spores ignore terrain movement costs.\n\nBased on Lost Planet 3 concept art, uncredited on their website: https://www.videogamesartwork.com/games/lost-planet-3/monster-concept</AA_RedSpore.description>

Royal Aves were originally wild Meadow Aves that have been crossbred for generations to reduce their stubbornness and increase their fluffiness. Some of these prized pets get freed into the wild, a life that they are poorly adapted for. Plumage in Royal Aves is more flamboyant than usual: if lucky you might get your hands on the incredibly rare Rainbow Ave, which does nothing special besides from looking bizarre.\n\nRoyal Aves are amazing mounts, much faster than horses, and if properly trained they can be ridden into battle at incredible speeds (this interaction needs the Giddy-Up, combat mounts mod, and it will make the Royal Aves move 50% faster when used as mounts).</AA_RoyalAve.description>

Instead of a light reflecting pelt, the sand lion has the unique ability of constantly digging into sand, producing dense clouds of particulate matter that obscures line of sight of its prey, making it easier for the lion to attack them.\n\nDue to this ability, attacking a sand lion with guns is not really advisable, unless they are VERY big guns.</AA_SandLion.description>

Their name is derived from their aggression against potential rivals during mating season, where the females are seen charging and locking horns with each other to secure a mate. While they were once used as battle mounts due to their speed and ability to ram, nowadays they are mostly reared across the rim for their creamy milk and abundant meat.\n\nSpecial abilities: Shadow chargers provide very good amounts of milk, and they can defend themselves much better than cows.</AA_ShadowCharger.description>

Interestingly enough, the shock goat has characteristics common to many other Rim species, such as three pairs of eyes, and characteristics typical of Earth goats, such as the horns. This points to the conclusion that shock goats are actually a fertile cross-bred of two different creatures, created in the past by some human colony, and released in the wild for unknown reason.\n\nWhatever the mystery behind their origins, nowadays they are commonly seen in farming communities in several Rim worlds, because they produce decent amounts of milk.</AA_ShockGoat.description>

The result, however, was completely unexpected: Skiphounds uncontrollably use their latent psionic powers to "blink" in and out of existence, making them extremely unpredictable.\n\nSkiphounds will use this psionic power constantly, unless eating or sleeping. An attacking Skiphound will rapidly teleport close to its prey, rendering a lot of defenses such as barricades and walls completely useless.</AA_Skiphound.description>

The Slurrypede is a modified bio-mechanoid capable of devouring almost anything and processing it into a homogeneous organic slurry. This slurry is edible for carnivore and omnivore animals, but barely, and completely indigestible for herbivores.\n\nSlurrypedes are docile, almost never hostile, and in case a mechanoid base is destroyed and one of them manages to survive, they tend to roam the wilderness aimlessly, consuming any organic material in their path and turning it into nutrient paste.</AA_Slurrypede.description>

Some of these animals, however, were pests, hitching a ride inside spaceships and multiplying at the expense of humanity. Swarmlings were one of such pests. Historians of the Ordo Historia theorize that Swarmlings were one of humanity's first successful genetic engineering creations, bred to enrich the biosphere of Mars, until they hitched a ride aboard an interstellar-bound colony ship.\n\nSwarmlings are not very dangerous on their own, but... they are never on their own. They are an asexual species with a weird reproduction cycle: once they attack another creature, they implant larvae on it, and they hatch once the creature has died.</AA_Swarmling.description>

  <AA_BlackSpider_Temporary.description>Not actually a spider, the  blackspider is a genetically-engineered giant insectoid the size of a bear. This creature is part of the Black Hive, an artificial ecosystem of insectoids designed to fight mechanoid invasions. The Black Hive was designed to be much more aggressive than usual, and several new species were created and added to the Hive to increase its lethality. Designed for heavy work and combat, its thick chitinous armor makes it hard to kill, while its long ripper-blades make it deadly at close quarters.\n\nArt by Gon (check more at https://twitter.com/GON_again).</AA_BlackSpider_Temporary.description>

  <AA_MammothWorm_Temporary.description>An extremely large, genetically-engineered worm. Despite its incredibly intimidating size and arsenal, these huge creatures are rather quite peaceful. It was once part of the worker caste of an artificial ecosystem of insectoids designed to fight mechanoid invasions. It carried and moved things that its little cousins cannot.\n\nWhile generally peaceful, if provoked, it becomes a terrifying force that can rival those of mechanoid Centipedes.\n\nOriginally, the Mammoth Worm was specifically bred as a living siege engine to destroy mechanoid structures, and as such it can be extremely effective.\n\nMammoth Worms are also pretty good mounts, they will move slightly faster when mounted, and shrug off incoming projectiles (this interaction needs the Giddy-Up, combat mounts mod, and it will make the Mammoth Worm move 25% faster when used as mounts and increase their armor by 50%).\n\nArt by Feroxiious (check her Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/feroxiious/).</AA_MammothWorm_Temporary.description>

  <AAVPE_BlackQueen.description>A giant, genetically-engineered insectoid responsible for creating new spawn. A mother to the insects of the black hive, the black queen is incredibly aggressive and doesn't shy away from brutal combat. As massive as an adult thrumbo, the queen instills fear in most opponents. Her thick chitinous armor makes her hard to kill, whilst long, deadly blades can tear through plasteel shielding in seconds and cause grievous, infected wounds.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:&lt;/color> The Black Queen regenerates health and her physical attacks have a 95% chance to cause infections.</AAVPE_BlackQueen.description>

  <AA_OcularOriginator.description>This amorphous translucent creature seems to lack everything but the most basic instincts, moving around slowly and sometimes devouring any plant it comes in contact with, incorporating it into its cytoplasm. To make its appearance even more unsettling, bloodshot eyes of various sizes float inside it, blinking spasmodically at random intervals.\n\nOcular originators are warped versions of the teratogenic originator, twisted by the strange energies of a perverse extradimensional realm of pure madness. The strange mutant eyes can be periodically excised from the creature and used at will. Ocular originators can't reproduce and only one will be present on a map at a given time.</AA_OcularOriginator.description>

  <AA_Fangsquid.description>A grotesque and terrifying creature born from the darkest depths of mutation. Resembling a mutated squid, its entire form is a nightmarish amalgamation of eyes, teeth, and tentacles. Its body is covered in a thick, slimy layer of oozing flesh, constantly secreting a sinister mixture of blood and viscera.\n\nThe Fangsquid possesses an uncanny ability to instill dread in anyone unfortunate enough to encounter it. The sheer sight of its grotesque visage and the eerie, unblinking gazes of its numerous eyes send shivers down the spines of nearby bystanders, invoking a primal sense of fear and terror.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:&lt;/color> Psychopaths and people with the Hemogenic gene will not be affected by the psychological dread caused by the squid. If you have Biotech, the squid can be farmed for Hemogen packs.</AA_Fangsquid.description>

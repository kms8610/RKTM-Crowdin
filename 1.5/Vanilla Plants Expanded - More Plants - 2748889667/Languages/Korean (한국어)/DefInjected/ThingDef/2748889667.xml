  <VCE_Moss.label>cave moss</VCE_Moss.label>
  <VCE_Moss.description>A nutrient-rich moss that can be used to feed cave animals, but not humans. It can grow on fungal gravel, but only in darkness - exposing it to any kind of light, including darklights, will kill it.</VCE_Moss.description>
  <VCE_Tinctshroom.label>tinctshroom</VCE_Tinctshroom.label>
  <VCE_Tinctshroom.description>A genetically-engineered mushroom which secretes a self-altering dye. This dye can be coaxed into different colors and used to dye apparel. It can grow on fungal gravel, but only in darkness - exposing it to any kind of light, including darklights, will kill it.</VCE_Tinctshroom.description>
  <VCE_Healshroom.label>healshroom</VCE_Healshroom.label>
  <VCE_Healshroom.description>A slow-growing mushroom which yields herbal medicine when harvested. Sowing and harvesting healshroom are both very labor-intensive tasks because of its fragility. It can grow on fungal gravel, but only in darkness - exposing it to any kind of light, including darklights, will kill it.</VCE_Healshroom.description>
  <VCE_VegMilkExtractor.label>vegetable milk extractor</VCE_VegMilkExtractor.label>
  <VCE_VegMilkExtractor.description>A small work station containing a presser and an industrial decanter centrifuge to separate vegetable extract from mash. The high G-forces generated by the decanter centrifuge allow you to extract vegetable milk from rice, almonds, coconuts, oats and soybeans.</VCE_VegMilkExtractor.description>
  <VCE_RawOats.label>oats</VCE_RawOats.label>
  <VCE_RawOats.description>The grain of the oat plant. Oats have numerous uses in foods; most commonly, they are rolled or crushed into oatmeal.

  <VCE_Barley.label>barley plant</VCE_Barley.label>
  <VCE_Barley.description>A cereal grain that people can use in bread, beverages, stews, and other dishes. As a whole grain, barley provides fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It has been genetically engineered to gently break into flour with a mere touch.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:&lt;/color> Barley is a "dual crop", in the sense that it produces both flour and hay.</VCE_Barley.description>
  <VCE_Sorghum.label>sorghum plant</VCE_Sorghum.label>
  <VCE_Sorghum.description>A drought resistant cereal used for food, animal fodder, the production of alcoholic beverages, and biofuels. Sorghum grain is gluten free, high in resistant starch, and more abundant and diverse phenolic compounds compared to other major cereal crops.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:&lt;/color> Sorghum stalks can grow to up to 2.5 meters in height, and grow very close together. A sorghum field can be used as quite effective cover.</VCE_Sorghum.description>
  <VCE_Rye.label>rye plant</VCE_Rye.label>
  <VCE_Rye.description>A plant that grows well in much poorer soils than those necessary for most cereal grains. Thus, it is an especially valuable crop in regions where the soil has sand or peat. It has been genetically engineered to gently break into flour with a mere touch.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:&lt;/color> Rye is only growable in sandy growing zones, which ignore fertility. These plants will however take a long time to sow and harvest, basically exchanging colonist work for growing plants in a normally unused space. Rye needs to be grown away from large bodies of water (water within 10 tiles of it will stop its growth).</VCE_Rye.description>
  <VCE_Oats.label>oat plant</VCE_Oats.label>
  <VCE_Oats.description>The oat, sometimes called the common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name. Oats have numerous uses in gastronomy, and they can also be turned into vegetable milk.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:&lt;/color> Oat has low yield, but it is very versatile, being a "dual crop", in the sense that it produces both flour and oats which can be either used as a vegetable or turned into milk.</VCE_Oats.description>

  <VCE_Blueberry.label>blueberry plant</VCE_Blueberry.label>
  <VCE_Blueberry.description>A shrub prized for its sweet edible fruits. Hailed as a "superfood", blueberries are commonly eaten fresh as a dessert fruit and can be baked in a variety of pastries.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:&lt;/color> Blueberries are pollinated by bees: they will receive a growth boost if an apiary is found in a radius of 6 tiles. To avoid lag this is only calculated once, when the plant is sown, so apiaries placed after sowing it will have no effect. If there are no apiaries it will behave as a slower strawberry plant.</VCE_Blueberry.description>

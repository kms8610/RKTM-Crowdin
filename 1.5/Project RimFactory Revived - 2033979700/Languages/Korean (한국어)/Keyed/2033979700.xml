  <PRF_DigitalStorageUnit_I_HelpText>The digital storage unit (DSU) functions like any other storage building, except all items put inside are moved to the middle cell, allowing for virtually infinite storage capacity. The actual limit is specified in the mod settings. Be cautious, as setting it too high can result in significant lag.\n\nTo mitigate lag in heavily used cargo platforms, the item readout in the "Items" tab only displays the first 500 items. You can, however, search for the item you want using the search bar.\n\nTo set direct DSU output right-click the desired output item in the DSU item list to have it move to the DSU output cell.\nYou can also right-click and select a pawn and force wear to equip items from storage.\n\nThe pawn access button controls whether pawns can directly manipulate the items in the DSU or if they are limited to interacting using the I/O ports.</PRF_DigitalStorageUnit_I_HelpText>

  <PRF_Conveyor_Simple_I_HelpText>Conveyor belts will send items along their path. They automatically connect to other belts, including other belts facing different directions, excluding belts facing each other. You can split stacks or selectively filter items to other belts using belt splitters (so long as the belt and splitter are both above or below ground). Linking above and below ground belts requires a subterranean entrance or exit, but pullers do not require this conversion regardless of their position.\n\nBelts are not sophisticated, they will shove the objects into any empty space in front of them, including storage containers and stockpiles. They also do not obey filter settings, this function requires using pullers.\n\nYou can set any segment as the "end belt" in settings to make the item stop in order to be used by an assembler, this does not require a shelf or hopper.</PRF_Conveyor_Simple_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_Wall_I_HelpText>Wall conveyor belts function similarly to standard conveyor belts except that they keep rooms insulated from one another. They work in conjunction with all puller types and link seamlessly with standard belts. You can direct their output into storage without using a puller.</PRF_Conveyor_Wall_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_UG_I_HelpText>Underground belts are capable of going under machinery and walls without issue. However, they do not interact with standard belts unless linked with subterranean entrances and exits. Underground belts also require the use of a puller or subterranean exit in order to retrieve items from underground. Keep in mind that splitters must also match: Above-ground belts use above-ground splitters, and underground belts use underground splitters respectively.</PRF_Conveyor_UG_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_Connector_To_UG_HelpText>Underground entrance: Required for use to merge standard belts with underground belts, however, they are not required in order to initiate any length of underground belt. In other words, you can link an above-ground puller directly to a standard underground belt to send it underground.</PRF_Conveyor_Connector_To_UG_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_Connector_To_Floor_HelpText>Underground exit: Required by underground belts in order to exit or interact with above-ground storage, stockpiles, and belts. Without an exit, an unterminated underground belt will carry items until something pulls it or another section of the underground belt is added.</PRF_Conveyor_Connector_To_Floor_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_Splitter_I_HelpText>Conveyer belt splitters work by splitting or filtering objects on a belt into two or three other directions. To do this, face the splitter away from your current belt then enable the output directions in settings. Each direction must be selected and then enabled, and each direction has its own set of filters. For instance: You can select north, enable north, and only select "chunks", then select and enable east, selecting everything but chunks. This would effectively filter any amount of chunks to the north, and the belt would continue east. With everything selected, the splitter splits stacks. With nothing selected, the splitter holds items.</PRF_Conveyor_Splitter_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_SimplePuller_I_HelpText>A simple item puller, slower than later versions.\nIt can pull from belts, crates, DSU, stockpile zones, shelves, and smart hoppers. Is toggled off by default and requires being activated in order to function. Not required to terminate a belt into storage, but can help with more advanced logic. To get better control, set filters and settings. By default, pullers will not output if the item is not allowed in at the target destination or if the output is blocked by a wall or another item.\n\nThe white cells represent the input range, and the yellow cell represents the output.</PRF_SimplePuller_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_GrowzonePuller_I_HelpText>A growzone puller works like any other puller, but instead of drawing from a stockpile zone, it will collect any items on the floor in an adjacent growzone. This allows it to pick up harvested plants that haven't been hauled yet.</PRF_GrowzonePuller_I_HelpText>

  <PRF_SmartHopper_HelpText>The smart hopper pulls in nearby items from the ground or stockpile cells onto itself and holds them so that they can be used by an assembler.\n\nIf you want to use it on an assembler, remember to enable the assembler's "toggle allow forbidden" option to allow the assembler to pull from the hopper.</PRF_SmartHopper_HelpText>

  <PRF_AutoCrafterSimple_HelpText>The S.A.L or "Station Automation and Logistics" is an alternative style of automation that replaces a regular pawn at a workbench. If you place it where a pawn would stand facing a workbench and power it, it will do the work as if it were a pawn with stats appropriate to each model of S.A.L. Materials for recipes can be placed adjacent to the device. The S.A.L will perform work in ways that standalone factory buildings might not be capable of without significant compatibility patching, so feel free to use them anywhere you see fit.\n\nThis first-generation unit is capable of performing most bills at a skill level of 5 and cooking with a skill level of 4.
